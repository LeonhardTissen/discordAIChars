cd discordAIChars
```

3. Install the dependencies

4. Create a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and invite it to your server. Make sure it has the `Manage Webhooks` permission and the message intent enabled

5. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the required values

```env

BASE_MODEL=llama3
PREFIX=!
MAXIMUM_MODEL_CHAIN=5

7. Run the bot with `node main`

## Get started üöÄ

1. Type `!create` to start the creation of a new model. The bot will ask you for a name, then a profile picture, then the prompt for the model
2. Type `!default [name]` to make that model the default for the channel. Now all messages will be responded to by the bot
