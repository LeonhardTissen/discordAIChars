```

2. Change into the directory

```sh
cd discordAIChars
```

3. Install the dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

4. Create a [Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and invite it to your server. Make sure it has the `Manage Webhooks` permission and all intents enabled

5. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in the required values

```env
BOT_TOKEN=YourBotTokenHere
CHANNEL_ID=YourChannelIdHere
BASE_MODEL=dolphin-llama3
IMAGE_RECOGNITION_MODEL=llava-llama3:8b-v1.1-q4_0
PREFIX=!

6. Download the models of your choice from [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library), for example:

```sh
ollama pull dolphin-llama3
ollama pull llava-llama3:8b-v1.1-q4_0
```

7. Run the bot

```sh
node main
```

![Get Started Section](github/getstarted.png)

1. Type `!create` to start the creation of a new model. The bot will ask you for a name, then a profile picture, then the prompt for the model
2. Type `!default [name]` to make that model the default for the channel. Now the bot will respond to all messages in that channel with that model
